         <li> Guatemalan Tacos </li>
            <p> My mother always makes the best Guatemalan tacos. When I come home from school I can always smell when she's making them. It gives me a really warm feeling inside. I love my mothers cooking! </p>

         <li> Ham and  Pineapple Pizza ! </li>
                <p> Out of all the pizzas and different toppings and sauces there are, my favorite is ham and pineapple. There are a ton of people who think fruit does not belong on pizza but that is only because they have no TASTE BUDS!!! Ham and Pineapple is the BEST! </p>

      <h2> Movies </h2>
      <ol>
        <li> Maleficent </li>
            <p> I've seen this movie over and over again because I love it that much. Maleficent is based on the origins of the Sleeping Beauty tale and shows how Maleficent came to be. It provides a different side and a movie towards the villain and changes the narrative that villains do get happy endings. </p>
