                        <li> Singing </li>
                                <p> I started singing when I was
            10 years old. I joined a band at my local church and that's when I knew I wanted to be a singer. I've been singing since I was a little girl but I never really experienced a deep feeling for it until I joined my band! </p>

                            <li> Drumming </li>
                                    <p> I started drumming when I was 12. I began to learn because there would be times when the drummer in our band couldn't make it so I began to learn and my cousin taught me. I love drumming it helps me relieve stress and gets me really HYPE! </p>

                            <li> Photography </li>
                                    <p> I've always liked taking photos but I never really considered photography until I got my first camera. I have a Canon 6D that I bought myself 2 years ago and ever since i've always had an interest in photography. I like taking pictures of a variety of things whether it be people, places, or food. I mostly enjoy taking pictures of people and capturing moments. </p>

          <H2>Sports <h2>
            <ol>
              <li> Swimming </li>
                    <p> I started swimming my freshmen year in High School. At first it was very hard but I practiced everyday and eventually became really fast and I could hold my breath longer underwater. I swim often but not as much as I used to due to an allergic reaction I had to the chlorine in the water but hopefully in time I will swim again. My goal is to learn all the different strokes! </p>
