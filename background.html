                <h2> Traditions </h2>
                        <p> Every sunday we go out to my grandmother's house and we do a barbecue and we sit around and play fun activities. We always celebrate holidays and we gather around no matter how big our family is. </p>
                <h2> Stories</h2>
                        <p> My parents always sit me and my brothers down to talk about life lessons and their stories when they were younger. I love listening to them they inspire me and they make me feel so good and proud of who my parents are. They tell us stories about their journies as teenagers and their stories about coming here to the United States in hope of a better future for me and my brothers. I am so proud to be latina and I am so proud to be the daughter of immigrants from their beautiful place that they call home which is Guatemala. </p>
